This is the website that you're currently on. I got inspired by developers online for this. Gatsby is amazing when it comes to SEO and is also a static site generator, so naturally it seemed like a great fit for this project. The site reads data from markdown files, which makes it easy for me to add content. It also has a cool dark mode switch.
